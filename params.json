{"name":"Behavioral Spherical Harmonics","tagline":"Behavioral Spherical Harmonics","body":"### Behavioral Spherical Harmonics.\r\nWe introduce behavioral spherical harmonic (BSH), a novel approach to efficiently and compactly represent the directional-dependent behavior of agent. BSH is based on spherical harmonics to project the directional information of a group of multiple agents to a vector of few coefficients; thus, BSH drastically reduces the complexity of the directional evaluation, as it requires only few agent-group interactions instead of multiple agent-agent ones. We show how the BSH model can efficiently model intricate behaviors such as long-range collision avoidance, reaching interactive performance and avoiding agent congestion on challenging multi-groups scenarios.\r\nFurthermore, we demonstrate how both the innate parallelism and the compact coefficient representation of the BSH model are well suited for GPU architectures, showing performance analysis of our OpenCL implementation.\r\n\r\n**Keywords**: spherical harmonics, behavioral model, agent-based simulation, long-distance interaction, collision avoidance, gpgpu\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n[Biagio Cosenza, PhD, Technische Universitaet Berlin](www.tu-berlin.de/?id=cosenza)\r\n\r\n### Sources\r\nSource code will be available here after the conference (September 2015).\r\n\r\n### Images and Videos\r\nComing soon.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n* Biagio Cosenza. _Behavioral Spherical Harmonics for Long-Range Agentsâ€™ Interaction._ The 3rd Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Agent-Based Simulations (PADABS)\r\n\r\n### How to cite\r\n\r\n    @inproceedings{CosenzaPADABS15,\r\n      author    = {Cosenza, Biagio},\r\n      title     = {Behavioral Spherical Harmonics for Long-Range Agents' Interaction},\r\n      booktitle = {Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Agent-Based Simulations (PADABS)},\r\n      year      = {2015},\r\n      pages     = {}\r\n    }\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
